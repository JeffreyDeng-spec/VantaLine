# Configuration reference

**Status: Authoritative**

This document lists ownership and names, never secret values or production endpoints.

## Configuration layers

- **Git-tracked defaults/contracts:** safe defaults, schemas, `release/plc-protocol.json`, dependency locks, migrations.
- **PostgreSQL runtime settings:** shared application records and workstation-specific PLC configuration/leases.
- **Restricted server environment:** database connection, provider credentials, runtime paths, trusted origins, release metadata overrides.
- **GitHub Environment secrets:** restricted deployment user/host, pinned SSH material, and deployment-only credentials.
- **Browser state:** workstation HttpOnly cookie, selected serial permission, active in-memory reader/writer and lease state.

Common backend variable families include `VANTALINE_POSTGRES_DSN`, `INSPECTION_AI_*`, `INSPECTION_CORS_ORIGINS`, and release/version inputs consumed by packaging. Exact accepted settings must be confirmed against typed server configuration before adding a value; examples are placeholders.

## Rules

- Never commit `.env`, private keys, tokens, cookies, real DSNs, production addresses, customer data, or copied server environment files.
- Do not add a second configuration source for an existing setting.
- Server-wide settings belong in controlled environment/runtime configuration; workstation PLC addresses belong to the bound workstation record.
- Defaults must be fail-closed for external I/O.
- New configuration requires schema validation, permission definition, documentation, tests, and explicit behavior for missing/invalid values.
