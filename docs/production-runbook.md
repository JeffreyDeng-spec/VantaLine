# Production runbook

**Status: Authoritative**

## Read-only diagnosis first

1. Check the GitHub workflow and immutable Release for the expected commit.
2. Query `/api/version`; verify release, full Git SHA, build time, backend/frontend protocol, and `consistent=true`.
3. Check the service is active and inspect recent error-level logs.
4. Check current release symlink, disk space, database connectivity, and PLC active/in-flight leases before considering deployment action.

Do not place real hosts, usernames, keys, or DSNs in commands committed to this repository. Obtain deployment access from the approved secret store.

## Deployment behavior

A successful push CI for `main` triggers `Release and deploy production` automatically. The workflow creates one immutable artifact, verifies checksums/version/protocol, uploads it through the restricted account, runs the installer, atomically switches `current`, restarts once, and performs acceptance. GitHub Release publication occurs only after acceptance.

The installer requires at least 2 GiB free under `/opt/vantaline`. If the disk gate fails, inspect usage first. Prefer deleting reproducible caches, package caches, expired logs, disabled package revisions, and failed incoming artifacts. Never remove shared customer data, databases, current/rollback releases, model outputs, or backups without a separate verified retention decision.

## Failure and rollback

- Build/contract failure: fix through a new PR; do not deploy a local artifact.
- Upload/SSH failure: verify GitHub Environment secret availability and pinned host identity; never paste keys into logs.
- Preflight failure: resolve the named gate and rerun the failed workflow job only when its immutable inputs remain unchanged.
- Acceptance failure: installer restores the previous `current` release and restarts; retain failed release/log evidence.
- Runtime regression after accepted deployment: deploy/revert a complete prior immutable release. Never mix frontend/backend files.

## PLC incident triage

Confirm browser support, HTTPS/Permissions Policy, workstation binding, active lease/epoch, configuration generation, profile verification, protocol consistency, and receipt evidence. ACK/NAK can be conclusive; timeout, malformed response, residual bytes, browser crash, or lost receipt is uncertain and must not be resent automatically. Ordinary website availability does not imply PLC effective enablement.
